\section{First section}

Here is the content of my first section. Here is a new modification I am making which will add some new text into the file.

And here is a new paragraph which contains some more amazing words of wisdom. It's great touch-typing! And some more.

There are several paragraphs in it as you can see.

\section{Second section}

And this is the Second section, which also has a couple of paragraphs in it aswell.
